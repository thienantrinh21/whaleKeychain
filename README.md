# whaleKeychain
One of my favorite projects.
First thing that I  learned to create in SolidWorks was this whale to gather more information about the different features they had to offer. This part was originally mean to be a single pencil holder (hence the hole still in the part) but 3D printing caused me to change my design to a keychain so it wouldn't be so expensive to print
